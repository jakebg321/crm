# Performance Optimizations for GreenLead CRM

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve the loading time between tabs and overall application responsiveness.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. React Query for Data Caching
- Implemented React Query to cache data between page navigations
- Set up optimal caching times for different types of data (staleTime: 60s, cacheTime: 5min)
- Configured query client to avoid unnecessary refetching (refetchOnWindowFocus: false)

### 2. Prefetching Data on Hover
- Added navigation link prefetching with `<Link prefetch={true}>`
- Implemented custom prefetching on hover/focus for main navigation items
- Prefetch related data when users hover over navigation links

### 3. Skeleton Loading UI
- Created skeleton UI components for common element types (tables, cards, etc.)
- Improved perceived performance by showing content placeholders while data loads
- Used AnimatePresence from Framer Motion for smooth transitions between loading states

### 4. Navigation Progress Indicator
- Added linear progress indicator at the top of the page during navigation
- Provides visual feedback during page transitions
- Improved perceived performance during tab/page switches

### 5. Optimized Component Re-rendering
- Used React.memo and useMemo hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented useCallback to maintain stable callback references
- Optimized filter operations to avoid redundant calculations

### 6. Initial Data Preloading
- Preload commonly used data on initial app load
- Implemented data fetching strategy based on current view timeframes
- Added targeted prefetching for specific routes

## Benefits

1. **Faster Tab Switching**: Tabs now load significantly faster because data is cached and doesn't need to be re-fetched
2. **Smoother Navigation**: Visual loading indicators and skeleton UI improve perceived performance
3. **Reduced API Calls**: Data is reused between views, minimizing redundant network requests
4. **Better User Experience**: The app feels more responsive and fluid

## Technical Implementation

- Used React Query's `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks for data fetching
- Created specialized data fetching hooks in `/src/hooks/` directory
- Integrated with Next.js client-side navigation for optimal performance
- Updated layout components to support loading transitions
